      “Animals are a gift from above for they truly define the words, unconditional love.”
As most of us love animals and also want to have one with us. So searching for the right pet becomes hard, here our website will help them by connecting people who want to adopt a pet and donate a pet.
 Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets and are euthanized in shelters every day around the world. If we Humans can find homes for them, many precious lives can be saved and many families can be created.
The project contains user details, pet details, pet donation records, abandoned pets records, pet inquiry records, and article records. In the project, we update pets about their availability means if a pet is adopted, then the records of that pet is deleted from the list. Users can search and filter pets about their breed, color, city, etc. Different pets have different prices, and some pets are free to adopt. User enrolment is compulsory to adopt a pet or donate a pet.

           The web application Docto  acts as a client whereas the database 
      containing  the doctor’s  details, patient’s details and appointment details is maintained by a website
       that acts as a server.
       In hospitals or Doctor's clinics, you have to first wait to make an appointment and meet with the doctor to 
       discuss your health problems. Also, you have to often travel to different places like medical store which is 
       again a burden of carrying documents. You have to visit on another day or after some hours to collect reports 
       which involve extra care person with patients anytime.
        Whereas In DoctoApp, you meet with online doctors and all manual process has been
        automated. Patients have to fill the online form by which id and password are created and sent to their 
        emails and upon accepting data, automatic login to the patient panel is generated. Through this panel, patients 
        can have appointment with the doctor of their choice, at their preferred time and location. Patients will get all 
        their reports and medicine prescriptions in their inbox by notification sent just after the appointment session.
